# shocking-javascript
I did this on codecademy. Thought some people might like to see this and learn from these unobfuscated codes. 
<b> Fill in 'insert age here' with your age and see how old you are in dog years or cat years! Or replace 'insert number here' with the kelvin you want to turn into farenheit, celsius and newton. Do this on a site that actually releases
an output from javascript like codecademy's js reader or https://www.typescriptlang.org/. </b>

<i> Feel free to make pull requests with your own codes to add it! That might be cool. </i>
